I, at first, wanted to make a very interactive game. Such a set up as a moving character and options
to pick up items and recieve points or upgrades. It was a little difficult for me at first to set up all the 
small details of being interactive. 
I wanted to make a smaller project and was thinking of games I use to play when I was younger and had thought of tic tac toe.
I did feel it could be an oppritunity for me to really work in css since we had a lot of class time practicing. 
I wanted a small score board and an option to clear the board to start new. I've seen a lot of code for this
game as well and had help creating and understanding.

Additional notes since creation: I did have help with one of my friends for the javascript section and I still 
need more work on understanding js code. I am working on remembering how to connect my css to my html.

The simple thought of tic tac toe in my head is a table 3x3 and connecting the styling to show it on the website version.
I created first all the code to set up the table and had an issue where I deleted my code to show the table on the website verzion.
I'm in the process of recreating my code to make it playable.
